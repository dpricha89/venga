    "itinerary": "Paddle from one beautiful bay to another as we uncover the wonders of this amazing coastline. We quickly grow accustomed to days spent kayaking, snorkeling, stand up paddle boarding and hiking into the desert canyons. Snorkel with young and inquisitive sea lions at the permanent sea lion colony of Los Islotes. Greet the dawn with a good stretch during a relaxing yoga session amidst unparalleled tranquility. Cap each evening off with good company and comfortable lodging, including three nights camping on the beach beneath the starry night sky in very roomy, safari-style tents.",
